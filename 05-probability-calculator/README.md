# Probability_Calculator
Python Project (problem from freeCodeCamp.org – Scientific Computing with Python course)

## Description:
This project helps to estimate the chance (probability) of drawing a group of colored balls from a hat. The result is found by doing many random tests (experiments). This follows the Monte Carlo method. The more tests we do, the more accurate the result is.

## Features:

  Create a Hat with different colors and number of balls.
  
  Draw balls randomly without putting them back.
  
  Repeat the experiment many times to find how often the expected result happens.
  
  Return the final probability.
  
  Works with any number of balls and colors.
  
  Keeps the original hat safe using deep copy.

## What It Calculates:
  
  Random draw from the hat.
  
  How many balls of each color are picked.
  
  If the picked balls match the expected result.
  
  Final probability = number of successful draws / total experiments.

## What I Learned:

  How to use Python classes and keyword arguments.
  
  How to use copy.deepcopy() and random.sample().
  
  How to simulate a real-world problem using Python.
  
  How to organize clean and reusable code.
