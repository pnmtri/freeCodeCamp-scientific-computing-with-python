# freeCodeCamp â€“ Scientific Computing with Python

This repository contains my solutions to the **Scientific Computing with Python** projects from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  
All projects are written in **Python 3** and organized in separate folders.

## Projects

1. **Arithmetic Formatter**  
   Formats a list of arithmetic problems vertically and side-by-side, with optional answers.  
   **Folder:** [`01-arithmetic-formatter/`](01-arithmetic-formatter)

2. **Time Calculator**  
   Adds a given duration to a start time, returning the new time, day, and AM/PM correctly.  
   **Folder:** [`02-time-calculator/`](02-time-calculator)

3. **Budget App**  
   Tracks spending and deposits in budget categories, with a text-based spending chart.  
   **Folder:** [`03-budget-app/`](03-budget-app)

4. **Polygon Area Calculator**  
   Calculates area and perimeter for rectangles and squares; can visualize shapes.  
   **Folder:** [`04-polygon-area-calculator/`](04-polygon-area-calculator)

5. **Probability Calculator**  
   Uses probability simulation to estimate the chance of drawing certain balls from a hat.  
   **Folder:** [`05-probability-calculator/`](05-probability-calculator)
