# Polygon_Area_Calculator
Python Project (problem provided by freeCodeCamp.org - from Scientific Computing with Python course)

## Features
- Create a `Rectangle` with width and height.
- Create a `Square` (inherits from `Rectangle`) with one side.
- Calculate:
  - Area
  - Perimeter
  - Diagonal
  - Visual picture using `*`
  - How many times one shape fits inside another (no rotation)

## Tests
This project includes tests to check that:

- Inheritance works correctly

- Calculations are accurate

- Picture size limit is handled

- Square and rectangle objects interact correctly

## Learning Goals
- Understand Python classes and inheritance

- Practice clean code and method overriding

- Learn how to represent objects and reuse code

## How to run
```bash
python main.py
