# Time_Calculator
Python Project (problem provided by freeCodeCamp.org - from Scientific Computing with Python course)

**What I Learned from This Project**
Through building this add_time() function, I improved both my Python coding skills and problem-solving mindset. Here are the key things I learned:

**Time calculation is tricky.**
I realized that calculating time, especially when moving between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, needs careful attention to special cases like midnight (12:00 AM) and noon (12:00 PM).

**Edge cases matter.**
I learned how important it is to test edge cases like when time goes past midnight, or when adding minutes causes the hour to increase.

**The value of modular thinking.**
My original code was too long and not well structured. I understood the need to break logic into smaller parts (helper functions) to make the code easier to debug and understand.

**Be careful with weekday calculation.**
Calculating the correct day of the week after several days passed is not as easy as it seems. I improved my understanding of modulo operations and how lists work in Python.

**Clear formatting is important.**
I practiced how to format the output string properly, including leading zeros for minutes, correct AM/PM display, and clean formatting when showing the weekday or days later.

**Debugging teaches you the most.**
The biggest lessons came when things didnâ€™t work. Each bug helped me think more logically and write better code next time.

**Code readability matters.**
I also learned how important it is to keep the code clean, use good variable names, and write comments for future understanding.

And last but not least, I now strongly got the point of manual and theoretical preparation before coding after this project. Although after preparing for hours, my code still got some errors at first. However, comparing with the previous projects with Python, I see myself improved a lot with ideation before coding.
